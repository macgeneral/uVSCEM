# uVSCEM: unofficial VSCode Extension Manager

This little program is designed to address some limitations in air-gapped and proxy environments that currently occur due to partially missing proxy support in Visual Studio Code.  
It allows for the installation of extensions in DevContainers, even when a proxy is involved, by downloading and installing them manually via Python's [`requests`](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library.

It's currently a work in progress, and complete offline installation is still missing (integrating it is a minor step), but it should be good enough to be used as `"postAttachCommand"` in [`devcontainer.json`][devcontainer] for environments where a proxy is involved and where automatic extension installation currently fails due to various errors.

**It's a workaround for the following upstream issues in Visual Studio Code:**
- [ ] [#12588: Extension Proxy Support](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/12588)
- [ ] [#29910: CLI Proxy Support](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/29910)
- [ ] [How to make use of "code" cli command in postAttachCommand script](https://github.com/orgs/devcontainers/discussions/94)


## Getting started

You can use this projects [`devcontainer.json`][devcontainer] as a template or modify your `Dockerfile` accordingly:

```dockerfile
RUN pip install uvscem
```
(preferably after creating a virtual environment and a non-root user)

In your [`devcontainer.json`][devcontainer]
```json
{
  "postAttachCommand": "uvscem --config-file /path/to/devcontainer.json"
}
```

uVSCEM will then install (and update) all extensions listed in `devcontainer.json` each time Visual Studio Code or the DevContainer is (re)started or rebuild.

**Note**  
Ensure that your `Dockerfile` (or container) contains Python 3.8 or later and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/), [poetry](https://python-poetry.org), or [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/latest/) to install this package. Also, confirm that your `PATH` variable includes the (virtual) environment where the package was installed into (or use `poetry run uvscem` after installing it with poetry).

If you have a proxy (e.g. [Cntlm](https://cntlm.sourceforge.net)) listening on `localhost` it's best to add a line in your `/etc/hosts` or `C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts` file (if you have the required admin permissions to do so):
```
127.0.0.1	localproxy
```
and configure VSCode to use that domain in (User) `settings.json`.
```json
{
  "http.proxy": "http://localproxy:3128"
}
```

In your `docker-compose.yml` you could then specify the following (this is already included in the [devcontainer][devcontainer] example in this repository):
```yml
extra_hosts:
    - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
    - "localproxy:host-gateway"
```
This way, some extensions within the DevContainer still got internet connectivity (if they are proxy aware). GitHub's CoPilot for example tries to use `127.0.0.1` from the host's user proxy configuration (`"http.proxy":`) otherwise and unfortunately there's no possibility to configure that separately for the DevContainer.
